PATCH NOTES and Memos

"Delete page" which from profile-delete, reservation-delete, and if the user is administer, then there're review-delete.
It has to change just for common use, add the delete button on last page (for example profile - profileDelete, in this case every button in profile is not for just moving to profileDelete , but deleting info actually.) and if user clicked the button and delete something then status have to be in alert status for move to another page.
It's almost same as before BUT add the function which delete information. So after page (which means profileDelete) is only show that information is deleted. And when user in "profileDelete" page then user only can choose to go back AftMain or can stay. (Main page which showing after login)

1. Change all those pages 2. and add the function for elimination Database sentences. If I ended this things then just go back to work again. It's not an issue. just for perfection. Also i guess this work cannot be finished in 1week so it must be cutting work a lot of part. First, finished them roughly. if it's done, fixing it and fixing again and fix again rap them after think a lot. I got just a little time really but it's finished almost.
And i think most important thing is db connection in the last part. so don't ruin it.
